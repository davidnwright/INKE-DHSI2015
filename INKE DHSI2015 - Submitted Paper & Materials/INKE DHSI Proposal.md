Feb. 15 - Social Knowledge Creation in the Humanities

Call for Proposals
Social Knowledge Creation in the Humanities 
An INKE- and Iter-hosted event, in conjunction with the Digital Humanities Summer Institute 
7 June 2015 | dhsi.org
University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada
Proposals Due: 15 February 2015

You get more out of failure... there's forensics, there's a dead body on the floor. There's tape. 


How can we shape the future of scholarly production to address the needs of many? What existing tools and platforms stimulate knowledge creation across communities? In the digital age, what role do scholars play in inspiring, developing, or harnessing social knowledge creation?

This one day event, “Social Knowledge Creation in the Humanities,” will provoke conversation and stimulate activity around issues of social knowledge creation. We welcome researchers, students, and practitioners who wish to engage intellectually with this topic, as well as to do some hands-on experimentation with related practices and initiatives.

Confronting Erasure: What 3D Printing Might Teach Us About Fabricating Truth

This lightening talk confronts the following question: if we are attempting to revive erased spaces such as the New Westminster Chinatown by re-fabricating it, what responsibility do we have to the corpse's social, political, economic, and cultural aura. The basic question: how do we consider, integrate or confront an individual--or collective--emotional affect produced by the revival of the previously erased or inert? 

Materials

Scale

Memory

Erasure




As we build these assemblages of cultural spaces, what exactly are we activating in the social space? If we are "fixing" an erasure that we wrong, how are we "fixing" its intepretation as a 3D rendered object. 

What happens when the social constrictions for producing knowledge intercede upon the outcomes, rendering any knowledge creation or production inert?  

3D printing as reviving, in a tactile format, something which has not been quite erased. That is, while the buildings, streets, and cross-references may no longer exist, the memories, experiences, and cultural signatures do. The question becomes how do researchers seek to incorporate those things inside the tactile, miniature reproduction?

A question of scale? How can one possible "recreate" tactile objects without accounting for scale. Does something produced in miniature possess the same resonance? Does scale affect interpretation -- does rendering something in miniature then perform a reductive act upon the social, cultural, economic, political offence all over again? 
	- might connect the above to materials... how do the materials we are using to recreate the tactile reflect more erasure... does it render the real into plastic, for example. Do we want certain artifactual evidence to be reproduced in plastic or is its power in its erased state. IN other words, by rendering the object, do we in effect rob it of its aura and create another shallower aura that does not have the same resonance, or worse, displaces the aura of the erased object rendering its power inert?
	
	What about the presence of corrections on the refrabrication? How does one annotate the 3d model? Is there a track changes for a 3D object? In other words, we need not neglect the untransformative power of the phyusical object that, once produced, cannot accept changes, or show the marginalia or evidence of transformation. 
	
	Given that most reconstitutions of erased spaces tend toward the margins of society--those neglected, racially inferior, or coloured savages--what do we do when no margins exist in the objects that mark their cultural, economic, and aesthetic experiences.
	
	There are so many layers that cannot be peeled back because they have melted seemlessly into one another creating the perception of smoothness, refinement, and completion.    

The hardware of poco. What are the implications of hardware on the practice of redistributing postcolnial cultural artifacts. If we scan the materials with a HP scanner are we not just recolonializing the materials? 

Eating a steak with chopsticks is different than eating it with a spoon that is different from eating it with the hand. 

In other words, the meal is the same, but the way one engages with it is differnet. The software doesn't matter. 

Even the practice of the internet--a western colonialized space if there ever was one--makes for another kind of colonialization. Putting things on the web does not change things. It just remediates established colonial practices. 

Thinking about the term "fabrication" as creating a lie; making things up. What are the triggers associated with this tactile experience, particularly the emotional ones or the ones that elicit a response unexpected by the maker. 







Featured events include:
• Opening presentations by leading figures in this area
• Lightning talks, where authors present 4 minute versions of longer papers 
that have been circulated prior to the gathering, followed by a brief discussion (papers may be 
conceptual, theoretical, application-oriented, and more)
• Aligned workshops, where session leaders present tools and platforms for social knowledge creation and attendees have the opportunity to play and experiment in this environment
Proposals for lightning papers or aligned workshops should contain a title, an abstract (of approximately 500–750 words, plus list of works cited), and the names, affiliations, and website URLs of any presenters. Fuller papers will be solicited after proposal acceptance for circulation approximately 6 weeks in advance of the event. We are pleased to welcome proposals in all languages of our community, although we note that the chief working language of past gatherings has been English. Please send proposals on or before February 15th 2015 to Alyssa Arbuckle at alyssaarbuckle [at] gmail [dot] com.
“Social Knowledge Creation in the Humanities” is co-sponsored by the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI), Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL), Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE), Iter Community, and Iter: Gateway to the Renaissance. This event is happily organized by Alyssa Arbuckle, Bill Bowen, and Ray Siemens.
