##Three Sections: What I'm Thinking About Coming Out of That Shitty Paper I Wrote

##The Intermateriality of Objects or Made Things (Intertextuality - Interobjectedness)

How do we understand objects that are connected to each other... not satisfying any more to say "pop eats itself" or to draw on McLuhan's "new media hijack old media" - we need something more complex, particularly when there is often a social history to the object's fabrication -- made by community, the network is the author. 

Elliott, MacDougall, Turkel 
	- "every thing has a history" (Turkel) (but what history and if that history a fabrication - made up by the collective that designs, edits and posts it? What kinds of histories are we bringing forward (intermateriality) in our new-old objects? 

Very rarely does any of the discussion around materiality take into account things such as access when thinking about the different histories or objects. If, as Turkel suggests, every _thing_ has a history, what is the history of _things_ that are interconnected (the internet of things) be they material or otherwise... and there's that term again -- very meta (intermateriality - there are lines of force in my object that come from other objects / boiler plates / memories / storage media. The histories of material objects is no longer simply contained in the material _thing_ but in the myriad inter-materialities that go into making that thing (hard drives, thumb drives, magnetics, reading, writing, heating, cooling, extruding, melting. 

Need to think about things like error and how that manifests another kind of hidden history -- the errors are not usually brought forward, but represent facets of the object's material history. 
	 
Like Kari Kraus' Printing Fictions Assignment 
	- make an argument about Phillip K. Dick's "Pay of the Printer" not with words, but with things--specifically 3D printed things

##Repair

Steven J. Jackson "Rethinking Repair."

I'm also interested in how repair is a form of social knowledge creation. How communities of repair spring up (YouTube, ifixit, lifehacker). Repair is necessarily informed by lunchroom chatter, not formal systems and can extend the technology through social knowledge exchange. Particularly salient when the community can "file a commit" to update things or the notion of tinkering is inherent in the production of the object -- the community is itself essential to both success and--maybe more importantly--to failure. At the same time these groups then fabricate a history of repair. 

The tyranny of the update -- who will be updating materiality? What's the highest resolution we can achieve of an object's presence? How exact can we be? How do updates govern not only the tech, but also the access to the tech... mobility as presence in material reproduction - that you can take it with you! 

##"Thingyness"

If knowledge about these objects is derived from a social group - the communities that dominate Thingiverse, Instructables, and other sites like these, then there is an obligation to examine the socio-cultural biases of these communities and the histories / networks they are working from -- not always a Western angle -- a reproduction of what they've seen or what they think Western world wants to see -- very different things. 

What is the social infrastructure that produces "things" - maybe we should again look to William Carlos Williams' famous phrase: "no facts but in things" and think about how false that rings in today's technological reading and writing environment. Even Steven J. Jackson, when he asks us to think about broken worlds and recasts our sense of repair, suggests that "we live in the aftermath." The question becomes then, what is the lineage of that aftermath? Or, is it that the aftermath is simply the result that allows for the re-making of another object, another thing, made up of other things... everything is at once a thing and nothing -- a tinker, tailor, trinket; that is the new materiality. An immateriality that has no agency but to show us the aftermath.  

We might then begin to think about knowledge creation as algorythmic, something done by a machine or group of machines working together, curating, like google. 

What then is the authoritative version of a reproduced object -- what is the governing process of making -- if an object was once moulded by hands from clay, and we re-produce that object using myriad of technological tools, including hand-sanding, how do we demarcate this process from the original. We might well ask, what is the process of building simulacra, or the architecture of simulacra and how is this governed by the socio-cultural conditions of the anthroposcene.

What is the difference between storage and memory. 

Memory relies on space whereas storage does not  

What people are missing from discussions of materiality is the concept of space. Space here is conceptualized as physical presence somewhere that triggers triggers triggers the access to memory. Storage is often required to be access because of memory, not separate from it. 

Ones position in space is very important. What we miss in discussions of materiality in tech is the role space plays in the conversation. Mobility allows for different triggers and takes the agency of the human executing a program out of the equation.

Gps can trigger a memory contained in the phone activating it without action on the part of the human.
