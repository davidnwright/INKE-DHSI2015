#Of Things, Repair, and Thingyness 

##Disclaimer: when I say "things" or I say "when we make objects," I really mean to add "out o plastic" since that is so far the dominant extrusion media for 3D printing, but I don't want to pigeon whole the discussion that way because saying "made out of plastic" just already assumes the object is shit--we just think that for some reason -- something I'll think about in another forum.

##ERROR

SKIP

When we fabricate a material thing:

What kinds of 
**non-material** 
**immaterial?**
 histories are we bringing forward into the production of our new-old 3d printed objects? (Turkel et al.)

SKIP

	- As an example, the need to account for error and how error manifests or does not manifest a kind of hidden history (the restoring of silences) - the errors are not usually brought forward in the final fabrication, but represent facets of the object's material history. 
	- Error is itself a very valuable form of social knowledge creation. Making mistakes and fabricating untruths is a great way to think about the materiality of objects and the cultural triggers they might activate. 
	- And then, how do we account for these errors if they are resolved outside a single authorial instance? 

- In thinking about ?intermateriality? - how there are lines of force in both the object I might fabricate--and the process that moves me to that fabrication--come from other objects / boiler plates / memories / storage media. 
	- Understanding that social knowledge creation nude riles the histories of material objects and  is not contained in the material _thing_ but in the myriad inter-materialities (and media) that go into making that thing (hard drives, thumb drives, magnetics, reading, writing, heating, cooling, extruding, melting.
	- All of these elements can come from / and be transferred in and out of any part of the social knowledge community. 
	- It's a good way to understand how there is no "authoritative" fabrication (be it textual or otherwise) -- only digital files and social histories or sites where there is evidence of repeated fabrication.

##Repair

Drawing from Steven J. Jackson "Rethinking Repair" -- the big buzz essay in DH right now I know, I'm also interested in how repair works as a form of social knowledge creation. 
- How communities of repair spring up (YouTube, ifixit, lifehacker). 
- Repair is necessarily informed by lunchroom chatter, not formal systems and can extend the technology through social knowledge exchange. 
- Particularly salient when the community can "file a commit" to update things or the notion of tinkering is inherent in the production of the object -- the community is itself essential to both success and--maybe more importantly--to failure. 

##"Thingyness"

If knowledge about fabricated objects is derived from a social creativity - the communities that dominate Thingiverse, Instructables, and other sites like these - then there is an obligation to examine the socio-cultural biases of these communities and the histories / networks they are working from 
- not always a Western angle -- a reproduction of what they've seen or what they think Western world wants to see -- very different things. 

Social knowledge creation involves making the social infrastructure that produces "things" visible by asking how we better account for the triggers fabricated objects--particularly cultural ones--might induce in the communities who lay claim to that cultural knowledge?
- Do objects reproduced for cultural history always already signal colonialist practice for instance?  
- Do cultural groups want their objects reproduced, fabricated, or represented in whatever way (plastic, digital, etherial, tangible)?
	
Into this falls the central point: if the production of cultural objects is initiated, repaired, and fabricated by a social knowledge community, Does that community recognize what conditions of production it is mimicking.
	- Most often, this is the tenets of mass-production -- either through resistance to it (working through error, presenting error, using failure as an outcome) or through the perfection of the process (an accurate scale model of an Taiwanese Aboriginal Harvest Festival Alter).

##END
	
- At this point, we might well ask, does the age of imprecise mechanical reproduction activate an awareness of the social knowledge architecture that goes into fabricating cultural simulacra (**out of plastics???**), 

- Helping us make more visible how the act of making (or fabricating) is governed by the embedded colonial, patriarchal, industrial socio-cultural conditions of the anthroposcene.

What is the difference between storage and memory. 

Memory relies on space whereas storage does not  

What people are missing from discussions of materiality is the concept of space. Space here is conceptualized as physical presence somewhere that triggers triggers triggers the access to memory. Storage is often required to be access because of memory, not separate from it. 

Ones position in space is very important. What we miss in discussions of materiality in tech is the role space plays in the conversation. Mobility allows for different triggers and takes the agency of the human executing a program out of the equation.

Gps can trigger a memory contained in the phone activating it without action on the part of the human.
