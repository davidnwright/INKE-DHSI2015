#Of Things, Repair, and Thingyness 

##Disclaimer: when I say "things" or I say "when we make objects," I really mean to add "out o plastic" since that is so far the dominant extrusion media for 3D printing, but I don't want to pigeon whole the discussion that way because saying "made out of plastic" just already assumes the object is shit--we just think that for some reason -- something I'll think about in another forum.

##Things

How do we understand material objects, mostly cultural but not always, that are made, repaired, and reproduced by a social knowledge community? 

As you might have noted reading my paper, I'm drawing somewhat on Elliott, MacDougall, Turkel - "Everything New is Old Again" 

If, as Turkel suggests, "every thing has a history" (Turkel) the current wave of desktop fabrication techniques forces us to ask what history does a thing have exactly and what if that history is itself a fabrication - made up by the collective that designs, edits and posts it? 
- What kinds of 
**non-material** 
**immaterial?**
 histories are we bringing forward into the production of our new-old objects? 
	- As an example, the need to account for error and how error manifests or does not manifest a kind of hidden history (the restoring of silences) - the errors are not usually brought forward in the final fabrication, but represent facets of the object's material history. 
	- And then, how do we account for these errors if they are resolved outside a single authorial instance? 

- In thinking about ?intermateriality? - how there are lines of force in both the object I might fabricate--and the process that moves me to that fabrication--come from other objects / boiler plates / memories / storage media. 
	- The histories of material objects is not contained in the material _thing_ but in the myriad inter-materialities (and media) that go into making that thing (hard drives, thumb drives, magnetics, reading, writing, heating, cooling, extruding, melting.
	- All of these elements can come from / and be transferred in and out of any part of the social knowledge community. 
	- There is no "authoritative" fabrication -- only digital files and social histories or sites where there is evidence of repeated fabrication.

##Repair

Drawing from Steven J. Jackson "Rethinking Repair" -- the big buzz essay in DH right now I know, I'm also interested in how repair works as a form of social knowledge creation. 
- How communities of repair spring up (YouTube, ifixit, lifehacker). 
- Repair is necessarily informed by lunchroom chatter, not formal systems and can extend the technology through social knowledge exchange. 
- Particularly salient when the community can "file a commit" to update things or the notion of tinkering is inherent in the production of the object -- the community is itself essential to both success and--maybe more importantly--to failure. 

##"Thingyness"

If knowledge about fabricated objects is derived from a social group - the communities that dominate Thingiverse, Instructables, and other sites like these, then there is an obligation to examine the socio-cultural biases of these communities and the histories / networks they are working from -- not always a Western angle -- a reproduction of what they've seen or what they think Western world wants to see -- very different things. 

What is the social infrastructure that produces "things" and how does it account for the triggers fabricated objects--particularly cultural ones--might induce in the communities who lay claim to that cultural knowledge?
- Do objects reproduced for cultural history always already signal colonialist practice for instance?  
- Do cultural groups want their objects reproduced, fabricated, or represented in whatever way (plastic, digital, etherial, tangible)?
- Maybe we should again look to William Carlos Williams' famous phrase: "no facts but in things" and think about how false that rings in today's technological "reading" and "writing" environment. 
- Fabricated things do not show us facts, they tend to show us trinkets or, better put, the privileged production of objects that could be more efficiently produced by mass production 
	- Thinking of the way cats, cellphone cases, toilet parts, and car, plane, train models dominate sites like Thingiverse or instructables
	- Extend to thumb drives, dongles, insignias
	
Into this falls the central point: if the production of cultural objects is initiated, repaired, and fabricated by a social knowledge community, what conditions of production is that social knowledge community mimicking.
	- Most often, this is the tenets of mass-production -- either through resistance to it (working through error, presenting error, using failure as an outcome) or through the perfection of the process (an accurate scale model of an Taiwanese Aboriginal Harvest Festival Alter).
	
- At this point, we might well ask, in the age of imprecise mechanical reproduction, what is the social knowledge architecture of fabricating cultural simulacra (**out of plastics???**), and how is it governed by the embedded colonial, patriarchal, industrial socio-cultural conditions of the anthroposcene.

What is the difference between storage and memory. 

Memory relies on space whereas storage does not  

What people are missing from discussions of materiality is the concept of space. Space here is conceptualized as physical presence somewhere that triggers triggers triggers the access to memory. Storage is often required to be access because of memory, not separate from it. 

Ones position in space is very important. What we miss in discussions of materiality in tech is the role space plays in the conversation. Mobility allows for different triggers and takes the agency of the human executing a program out of the equation.

Gps can trigger a memory contained in the phone activating it without action on the part of the human.
