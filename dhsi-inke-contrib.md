Steps the DHSI @INKE Thing:

1. Import the notes from the event into this document
2. Focus some free-writing on the implications of Thingiverse as a space for control -- you are not actually encouraged to make, but to take. 
3. Community tends to work toward rejection rather than repair, upsetting the traditional apprenticeship relationship, prioritizing critique over learning; success over skills
4. The social aspect of these spaces tends to ignore racial questions, labour questions, and questions of gender and ownership... hiding behind the cloak of the esoteric user name... normalized engagement with "things"... you can make anything you want, as long as it's a useless, inoffensive trinket. 
5. limits of what can be made / shared / taken. Moral limits are set by the context of the community as dictated by the owners of that community space. No penises or bulging vaginas, no guns, firing pins, weapons. vibrators, etc.
6.  So, social knowledge creation then, in this context, is neutered to its most benign. Knowledge is not being shared or created; it is being judged, safely, by the normative. Everyone else is torrenting the dangerous stuff. 
7. While painted as subversive, innovative, cutting edge, it's actually none of these things. It is a normalized behaviour cloaked in "innovation" where no one invents anything--they just copy stuff. 
8. The rendering of always already existing objects is not creation, it's copying. Reproduction. Social Knowledge creation then, in this context, is about replication, reproduction, repetition (more popular, more noticeable, more successful, more iterations, better chance for success). 
9. Social knowledge creation in this context is not about developing proficiency, its about production. It mimics the capitalistic system if copies; it embeds the politics of capitalism into the process of knowledge production. Despite the copyright notices.
