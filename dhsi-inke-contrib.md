Steps the DHSI @INKE Thing:

1. Import the notes from the event into this document
2. Focus some free-writing on the implications of Thingiverse as a space for control -- you are not actually encouraged to make, but to take. 
- Take for example the experience of sites such as Thingiverse. These sites tend to share knowledge by posting files that are designed to share. One of the interesting things about these sites is that people are sent there as a way to circumvent actually knowing how to develop the files for the machine. The result is a localized form of costruction where very few can actually create the file, but any number of people can reproduce it. 
- This models something different. 
- The question of sharing and knowledge creation in this instance is interesting because... 
3. Community tends to work toward rejection rather than repair, upsetting the traditional apprenticeship relationship, prioritizing critique over learning; success over skills. The Thingiverse meters out the success of projects by counting the number of successful prints. 
4. The social aspect of these spaces tends to ignore racial questions, labour questions, and questions of gender and ownership... hiding behind the cloak of the esoteric user name... normalized engagement with "things"... you can make anything you want, as long as it's a useless, inoffensive trinket. 
	1. We might want to think about the implications of this direction. Knowledge and skills are no longer something that might challenge the status quo... instead, these skills become ways of measuring one's authority to be the status quo. A successful ironic plastic toilet could be your ticket to widespread fame.
	2. The "broke the internet" vibe plays a role in what knowledge and what kind of knowledge actually gets shared. Instead of that knowledge being validated by the standards of a set of disciplinary standards, such as physics, it is instead build up a kind of hacker menifest that prioritizes tinkering for the sake of success, rather than in order to set new standards. 
5. limits of what can be made / shared / taken. Moral limits are set by the context of the community as dictated by the owners of that community space. No penises or bulging vaginas, no guns, firing pins, weapons. vibrators, etc.
6.  So, social knowledge creation then, in this context, is neutered to its most benign. Knowledge is not being shared or created; it is being judged, safely, by the normative. Everyone else is torrenting the dangerous stuff. 
7. While painted as subversive, innovative, cutting edge, it's actually none of these things. It is a normalized behaviour cloaked in "innovation" where no one invents anything--they just copy stuff. 
8. The rendering of always already existing objects is not creation, it's copying. Reproduction. Social Knowledge creation then, in this context, is about replication, reproduction, repetition (more popular, more noticeable, more successful, more iterations, better chance for success). 
9. Social knowledge creation in this context is not about developing proficiency, its about production. It mimics the capitalistic system if copies; it embeds the politics of capitalism into the process of knowledge production. Despite the copyright notices.

#John Maxwell - The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work: Wikis & Convivial Knowledge Creation

- Ward Cunningham


- Simplicity and Openness
	- convivial tools are the ones that open possibilities
	- A pattern language - Merlin Mann
	- What happens when you "formalize" a pattern?
	- wikis are a systems of names of things and systems and trajectories... emerges over time according to how the community actually uses it. 
	- C2.com
	- Think about the simplest thing that could possibly work
- Simplicity
	- wiki is a big bag of content 
	- names, links, words (make connections)
##	- What about the complexity of "simplicity" - the pen and paper (the industrial implications behind that thing... rolling ball / retractable / pocket clip / pulp and paper manufacturing / ink manufacturing / the teaching infrastructure of reading and writing? Is simplicity a what unprivileged people call complexity?  mask for something else? Google looks simple, but it's not. 
	- How are these communities maintained and under what requirements can you join them? 
	- wiki is the textual embodiment of a community
-  Thinkubator (Maxwell's site)
- GetIt - git repository with a wiki backend
- Hapgood.us

##My Session

Me : How do I see the notion of competition - who decides what is the better or more authorative version? What about the collisions of culture - when the same cultural object is made by two groups - competition for the best made thing?

Digital Zombies
	- teaching students how to look beyond wikipedia
	- librarians and outside the classroom
	- the gamification of research
	- meaningful play -- can there be meaningful play?

Z Axis
	- open-sourced interpretation

## Session #2

Daniel Powell - participatory production / social knowledge - cutlrue circulates -- practices are always material / always social
##what about that materiality? What do you do with a thumb drive (both material and etherial (the code inside it)
	- materiality as an indicator of popularity and resonance ... thinking about the how the physical thing is manifesting something in the network -- 


##SEssion #3

- John - fucking brilliant - radio is a great way to think about grassroots anything... just so open. 

- Nicky Agate - MLA Commons - repository?
	- how do we resolve the version of record and the needs of the institution - funding - DOI 


###Day 2, or Day 1 Depending

So today began at the Starbucks as is my usual habit when attending DHSI, but then there was an interruption and now I am trying to find my footing again. Yesterday was a good session and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I didn't really see how social knowledge creation was gonna enthuse me, but it kinda did. If nothing else, it got me thinking about the fabrication project a little more clearly and brought to light how I will need to refine a few things going forward. Also, was nice to have dinner with Aaron Mauro, Dan Powell, Alex Christie, and John Maxwell. I'll be following up with John about some curriculum collaborations because he owes me for a pitcher of beer. 

The biggest outcome of the day for me was probably the idea that we should do a wikipedia edit-a-thon at the College. I thought that the way they described it at the Workshop during the Social Knowledge Creation event was much different than I had conceptualized it; using the event as a way to publicize the library's holdings and ways to engage with the library's collections. Breaking the edit-a-thon down into discrete parts was a great idea -- so that one only has to concentrate on what the library has evidence of -- seemed like a great approach. Choose a few thematic elements and roll with the editing from there. It might be a fun thing to do. 

Good lord there are a lot of seniors in Victoria. It's like a country for old people. A senior's home if it were a town.
